    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : int
        Random number seed to use to generate stochastic conditions.
        The seed determines the same seeing and transparency realization
        independent of the value of ``replay``.
    replay : str
        Either 'random' or a comma-separated list of years whose
        historical weather should be replayed, e.g. 'Y2010,Y2012'.
        Replayed weather will be used cyclically if necessary.
        Random weather will be a boostrap sampling of all available
        years with historical weather data.  Use 'Y2015' for the
        worst-case weather scenario.
    time_step : float or :class:`astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        Time step calculating updates. Must evenly divide 24 hours.
        If unitless float, will be interpreted as minutes.
    restore : filename or None
        Restore an existing weather simulation from the specified file name.
        All other parameters are ignored when this is provided. A relative path
        name refers to the :meth:`configuration output path
